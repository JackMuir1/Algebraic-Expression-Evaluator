# Algebraic-Expression-Evaluator
A program to read a complex algebraic expression and evaluate it using stacks

Using a given string defined in main, or using the built in functionality to read from an input file, this program will evaluate any algebraic expression that uses the four basic operators (+, -, *, /), along with parenthesis.

This program demonstrates how stack data structures are used to evaualte expressions through pemdas. Two stacks are created, one for operands and one for operators, and each element is placed in the stack, then popped and operated on based on the order of operations.

Features an animated console window demonstrating each process of the program, included the pushing and popping of each stack.
